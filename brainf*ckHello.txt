This is a sample program that will output hello using the brainfuck language:

> - Shift instruction pointer right
< - Shift instruction pointer left
+ - Increase value at the instruction pointer
- - Decrease value at the instruction
. - Output the character stored at the pointer location 
, - Input the character stored at  the pointer location
[ - Jump past the matching ] if the value stored at the current pointer is 0
] - Jump back to the matching [ if the value stored at the current pointer is nonzero

* All other symbols are seen as comments and are ignored


Printing "Hello!":

We could brute force this by incrementing each cell to its corresponding char value and output. This would be a lot of work and would not look clean in practice.
What we can do instead is get "close" then modify the cells at those locations to get the output that we want.


We start with a loop that estimates where we want our cells to be close to when we print out our values

+++++++++
[
 >++++++++ //9*8 = 72
 >+++++++++++ //9*11 = 99
 >++++ //9*4 = 36
 <<<-
]

Here we are back at cell 0 with the following values

index 0  1  2  3
value 0  72 108 36

And can execute the following
>. // outputs H
>++. // outputs e
+++++++.. //outputs ll
+++. //outputs o
>---. //outputs !


Running this will output Hello! and completes our program
